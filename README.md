> some fun staff I wrote while learning Scala ([ZH](./README_ZH.md))

## Description
Currently, this repo contains some implementations of the common algorithms and data structures.  

1. Binary Tree  
2. Large Integer Calculator (via LinkedList)
3. The Sorting Algorithms  
4. Simple Directed Graph and Related Algorithms
5. Type Class Example

## Usage
Checkout the test cases in the test package

## Notice
Rather than using sbt as the build tool, which is recommended, I chose gradle to set up this repo.
