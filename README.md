> some fun staff I wrote while learning Scala

## Description
For now, this repo already had some implementations of the common algorithms and data structures.  

1. Binary Tree  
2. Large Integer Calculator
3. The Sorting Algorithms  
4. Graph impl 

I will keep adding more and more features to this repo, hoping it can be a good learning resource to 
those who want to find their way in the Scala world. Also, I would try my best :yum: to use the Scala built-in features
(ie. pattern matching, tail-recursion) to solve the problems.

PS. If you have any advice or recommendation, feel free to fire an issue or pull request. :heart::heart::heart: 

## Usage
Checkout the test cases in the test package

## Notice
Rather than using sbt as the build tool, which is recommended, I chose gradle to set up this repo.
